	<p class="content"> Hyperlinks are really important â€” they are what makes the Web a web. This article shows the syntax 
	required to make a link, and discusses link best practices.</p>
	<div class="shade">
		<strong>Prerequisites:</strong>	Basic HTML familiarity, as covered in Getting started with HTML. HTML text formatting, as covered in 
		HTML text fundamentals.<br><br>
		<strong>Objective:</strong>	To learn how to implement a hyperlink effectively, and link multiple files together.

	<br><h1>What is a hyperlink?</h1><br>
	<p class="content">Hyperlinks are one of the most exciting innovations the Web has to offer. They've been a feature of the 
	Web since the beginning, and are what makes the Web a web. Hyperlinks allow us to link documents to other documents or 
	resources, link to specific parts of documents, or make apps available at a web address. Almost any web content can be 
	converted to a link so that when clicked or otherwise activated the web browser goes to another web address (URL).</p>
	<div class="note">
		<em>Note: A URL can point to HTML files, text files, images, text documents, video and audio files, or anything else 
		that lives on the Web. If the web browser doesn't know how to display or handle the file, it will ask you if you want 
		to open the file (in which case the duty of opening or handling the file is passed to a suitable native app on the 
		device) or download the file (in which case you can try to deal with it later on).</em>

	<p class="content">For example, the BBC homepage contains many links that point not only to multiple news stories, but also 
	different areas of the site (navigation functionality), login/registration pages (user tools), and more.</p>

	<br><h1>Anatomy of a link</h1><br>
	<p class="content">A basic link is created by wrapping the text or other content, see Block level links, inside an <a> 
	element and using the href attribute, also known as a Hypertext Reference, or target, that contains the web address.</p>
	<div class="shade">&lt;p&gt;I'm creating a link to<br>
	&lt;a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/"&gt;the Mozilla homepage&lt;/a&gt;.<br>
	&lt;p&gt;</div>
	<p class="content">Another attribute you may want to add to your links is title. The title contains additional information 
	about the link, such as which kind of information the page contains, or things to be aware of on the web site.</p>
	<div class="shade">&lt;p&gt;I'm creating a link to<br>
	&lt;a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/"<br>
	title="The best place to find more information about Mozilla's<br>
    mission and how to contribute">the Mozilla homepage&lt;/a&gt;.<br>
	&lt;p&gt;</div>
	<p class="content">This gives us the following result and hovering over the link displays the title as a tooltip.</p>
