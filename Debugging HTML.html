	<p class="content">Writing HTML is fine, but what if something goes wrong, and you can't work out where the error in the 
	code is? This article will introduce you to some tools that can help you find and fix errors in HTML.</p>
	<div class="shade">
	<em>Prerequisites:	HTML familiarity, as covered in, for example, Getting started with HTML, HTML text fundamentals, and 
	Creating hyperlinks.<br><br>
	Objective:	Learn the basics of using debugging tools to find problems in HTML.</em>

	<br><h1>Debugging isn't scary</h1><br>
	<p class="content">When writing code of some kind, everything is usually fine, until that dreaded moment when an error occurs — you've done 
	something wrong, so your code doesn't work — either not at all, or not quite how you wanted it to. For example, the 
	following shows an error reported when trying to compile a simple program written in the Rust language.</p>
	<br><img class="element" src="./Images/updated-bbc-website.png">
	<p class="content">Here, the error message is relatively easy to understand — "unterminated double quote string". If 
	you look at the listing, you can probably see how println!(Hello, world!"); might logically be missing a double quote. 
	However, error messages can quickly get more complicated and less easy to interpret as programs get bigger, and even 
	simple cases can look a little intimidating to someone who doesn't know anything about Rust.<br><br>
	Debugging doesn't have to be scary though —  the key to being comfortable with writing and debugging any programming 
	language or code is familiarity with both the language and the tools.</p>
	<h1>HTML and debugging</h1><br>
	<p class="content">HTML is not as complicated to understand as Rust. HTML is not compiled into a different form before the 
	browser parses it and shows the result (it is interpreted, not compiled). And HTML's element syntax is arguably a lot easier 
	to understand than a "real programming language" like Rust, JavaScript, or Python. The way that browsers parse HTML is a 
	lot more permissive than how programming languages are run, which is both a good and a bad thing.</p>
	<h2>Permissive code</h2>
	<p class="content">So what do we mean by permissive? Well, generally when you do something wrong in code, there are two main types of 
	error that you'll come across:</br>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Syntax errors:</strong> These are spelling errors in your code that actually cause the program not to run, like the Rust 
		error shown above. These are usually easy to fix as long as you are familiar with the language's syntax and know what
		the error messages mean.</li>
		<li><strong>Logic errors:</strong> These are errors where the syntax is actually correct, but the code is not what you intended it to 
		be, meaning that the program runs incorrectly. These are often harder to fix than syntax errors, as there isn't an 
		error message to direct you to the source of the error.</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="content">HTML itself doesn't suffer from syntax errors because browsers parse it permissively, meaning that the page still displays 
	even if there are syntax errors. Browsers have built-in rules to state how to interpret incorrectly written markup, so 
	you'll get something running, even if it is not what you expected. This, of course, can still be a problem!</p>
	<div class="note">
		<em>Note: HTML is parsed permissively because when the web was first created, it was decided that allowing people to get 
		their content published was more important than making sure the syntax was absolutely correct. The web would probably 
		not be as popular as it is today, if it had been more strict from the very beginning.</em>
