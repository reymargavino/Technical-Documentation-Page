	<h1>What is HTML?</h1><br>
	<p class="content">HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is not a programming language. It is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure 
	the web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wants it to be. HTML consists of a series of 
	elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content to make it appear or act in a certain way. The 
	enclosing tags can make content into a hyperlink to connect to another page, italicize words, and so on.  For example, consider 
	the following line of text:</p>
	<div class="shade">
		<em>My cat is very grumpy</em>
	</div>
	<p class="content">If we wanted the text to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in a 
	paragraph  (&lt;p&gt;) element:</p>
	<div class="shade">
		<em>&lt;p&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;p&gt;</em>
	</div>
	<div class="note">
		<em>Note: Tags in HTML are case-insensitive. This means they can be written in uppercase or lowercase. For example, a 
		&lt;TITLE&gt; tag could be written as &lt;TITLE&gt;, &lt;TITLE&gt;, &lt;TITLE&gt;, &lt;TITLE&gt;, etc., and it will 
		work. However, it is best practice to write all tags in lowercase for consistency, readability, and other reasons.</em>

	<h1>Anatomy of an HTML element</h1><br>
	<p class="content">Let's further explore our paragraph element from the previous section:
	</p>
	<img class="element" src="./Images/grumpy-cat-small.png">
	<p class="content">The anatomy of our element is:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>The opening tag:</strong> This consists of the name of the element (in this example, p for paragraph), 
		wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This opening tag marks where the element begins or starts to take effect. 
		In this example, it precedes the start of the paragraph text.</li>
		<li><strong>The content:</strong> This is the content of the element. In this example, it is the paragraph text</li>
		<li><strong>The closing tag:</strong> This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before 
		the element name. This marks where the element ends. Failing to include a closing tag is a common beginner error that can 
		produce peculiar results.</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="content">The element is the opening tag, followed by content, followed by the closing tag.</p>
